- I have added a total interaction from student_log (excludes number of courses) - meaning total “web click” event
- ⁠I have added year of studies from year intake (first year or second year study)
- ⁠The accuracy i tried still hover around 50% accuracy (highest 55%)
- ⁠I have tried to change it into a binary classification - combined the distinction and good into 1, pass and fail into 0; And i managed to obtain highest 86% accuracy… should we continue binary classification moving forward?
